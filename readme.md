This is the To Do App from CÃ©dric Sutter.

To start it online, start the index.js.
Now the Rest Service should be running on "running at http://127.0.0.1:3001/".

Rest API:

get all To Do's: GET http://127.0.0.1:3001/  
create To Do: POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/  
delete To Do: DELETE http://127.0.0.1:3001/id
update To Do: PATCH http://127.0.0.1:3001/id

Open the index.html in the Public folder and start with the To Do App!
